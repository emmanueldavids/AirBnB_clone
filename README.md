# AirBnB clone - The console

## Discription Of The Project!
This is the first step towards building your first full web application: the AirBnB clone. This first step is very important because you will use what you build during this project with all other following projects: HTML/CSS templating, database storage, API, front-end integration.

## Description of the command interpreter?
Itâ€™s exactly the same as a shell but limited to a specific use-case. 

## How To Start it
1. Create a Readme file that contains the project Documentation.
2. You initiallize your git repository git init https://github.com/emmanueldavids/AirBnB_clone.git, then cd into repository.


## How To Use It
The shell works in 2 different ways:
**Interactive** and **Non-interactive**.

1. In Interactive mode
```
$ ./console.py
(hbnb) help

Documented commands (type help <topic>):
========================================
EOF  help  quit

(hbnb) 
(hbnb) 
(hbnb) quit
$
```

2. InNon-interactive mode
```
$ echo "help" | ./console.py
(hbnb)

Documented commands (type help <topic>):
========================================
EOF  help  quit
(hbnb) 
$
$ cat test_help
help
$
$ cat test_help | ./console.py
(hbnb)

EOF  help  quit
